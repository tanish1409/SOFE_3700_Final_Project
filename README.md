# Project Setup

## Required Software

1. **XAMPP Server**
2. **MySQL WORKBENCH BACKEND**
3. **PHP Frontend**
4. **Windows System with Active Internet.**

## Setup and Installation

### MySQL Workbench Setup

1. Navigate to the GitHub Phase-II folder and start by using the create commands. Run each table individually as they have dependencies.
2. Run the Populate Commands. Similarly, run these individually due to dependencies.
3. Run the Create_Views commands to ensure your views exist.

### XAMPP Server Installation

1. Install XAMPP Server and ensure that Apache can run on the same.
2. Copy all the files from the Phase-III folder to the `htdocs` folder in your XAMPP installation.

### Configuration

1. Open the following files from the copied Phase-III files and replace the username and password with your MySQL credentials. Ensure the localhost port and database name are correct:

   - `config.php`
   - `views.php`
   - `drug.php`
   - `customer.php`
   - `update_password.php`

Make sure to follow these steps meticulously to set up the project successfully. If you encounter any issues during the installation or configuration process, refer to the documentation or seek assistance online.
